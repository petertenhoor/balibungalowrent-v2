To use this feature, add comma separated values with both simple strings and/or regular expressions to match the desired selectors. Regular expressions must be preceeded by two forward slashes. For instance: <code>.button-special,//#footer</code>. In this example <code>.button-special</code> will match <code>.button-special</code> selector only, while <code>//#footer</code> will match <code>#footer</code>, <code>#footer-address</code> and <code>#footer-phone</code> selectors in case they exist.<br />Do take into account that changing this setting will only affect new/ updated rules, so you might want to remove old rules and clear your page cache to expedite the forceIncludes becoming used."
